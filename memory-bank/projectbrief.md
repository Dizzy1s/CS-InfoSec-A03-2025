# Project Brief

## Vision
Create a capture-the-flag style training platform where students log in with
their roll numbers to exploit intentionally vulnerable web flows (SQLi, XSS,
CSRF) and capture flags that prove mastery of each concept.

## Goals
- Provide a realistic but self-contained practice target with SQL backend.
- Showcase three core vulns (SQLi, XSS, CSRF) via distinct challenges.
- Track student progress per account and flag completion.
- Offer clear educational framing while remaining safe for classroom use.

## Non-Goals
- Production security / hardening (site is intentionally insecure).
- Broad vuln coverage beyond the three specified categories.
- Multi-tenant or internet-facing deployment requirements.
